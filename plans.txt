CHANGELOG:

- A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF (<v0.21)

- DATA (v0.21)
    - Save
    - Load

v 0.22:
    - Offline mode (save timestamp of last save so that on load calculate what should have been done)

v 0.23:

	- Change save/load messages to not be coupled to save/load functions
		- have calling functions log
    - Autosave (5 minute duration default, 1 minute minimum)
    - change income system
            - resources can impact income directly
            - instead of adding income, recalculate income on any change to resource table
    - Options

        - Show animations (toggle)

v 0.3:

	- adjust resourceList to html to darken span colour if a parameter is passed
	- add descriptions to options
    - save import/export
            - could be handled entirely in one text field in options menu
    - add ending screen
        - fade in overlay
        - show credits and end of game

v 0.4:

    - Gate tab
    		- unlocked through a lab upgrade
    		- requires a whole bunch of resources in different slots to open
    		- ends game on opening
	- Laboratory tab
	    - upgrades
	        - allow new things

	- add content for the expectation we don't get past diplomacy/trading tab
	



sharks
rays
crabs
fish
sand
science
crystal
kelp
sea apple - can be used for a science boost
sharkonium


DONE: [xenobiology] buy science with sea apples
DONE: [transmutation] buy sharkonium with crystal and sand

DONE: fish -> crab -> crystal (very slow) 

DONE: crystals + sharks -> science shark -> science
[regular biology] shark + lots of fish -> nurse shark -> sharks
[laser tech] crystals + rays -> laser ray -> -sand +crystals
[sea apples] sand + crab -> planter crab -> kelp

[automation] crystals + sand + sharkonium -> crystalminer -> +crystals (higher than crabs)
[automation] crystals + sharkonium -> autotransmuter -> -crystals +sharkonium
[automation] sharkonium -> fishmachine -> +fish (higher than sharks)




science:

- crystal bite-gear - shark multiplier x 2
- crystal spades - ray multiplier x 2
- crystal containers - science shark multiplier x 2
    - underwater chemistry - science shark multiplier x 2

    - seabed geology - rays multiplier x 2
        - thermal vents
            - laser rays - enable laser rays
            - automation - enable expensive but better structures
                - engineering - crystalminer x 2, autotransmuter x 2, fishmachine x 2
        - kelp horticulture - enable planter crabs
            - xenobiology - enable converting sea apples to science
                - regular biology - enable nurse sharks
            - sun observation - planters x 2

(thermal vents) (underwater chemistry)
    - transmutation - allows conversion of crystal to sharkonium

(seabed geology) (sun observation)
    - exploration - shark multiplier x 1.5, ray multiplier x 1.5
        - far exploration - crab multiplier x 3
			- gate exploration





                !!!!!!!!!!!!DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



				

v 0.48

Things to do: 
apply Dylan's fix, 
	change line 59 of ascii85 to (bytes.charCodeAt(i+3))) >>> 0;
reduce big costs by an order of magnitude or so, 
add "buy 10", "buy 1/3 max" and "buy 1/2 max" buttons
display research effects on research buttons,
display effectiveness multipliers in income table (after amount, before rate), 
provide better cost calculation: rather than have the calculation be a function, set costs to be based on constant or linear and call appropriate functions from cost lookup table?
add crab and ray generators and required tech
consolidate options pane and other panes into one generic pane!

changelog option	



v 0.5

- crab broods aren't massively OP now
- change planter crab colour to a colour that can be read on the button
- add useful metadata to index for bots, copyright note at bottom of page
The above variably named Shark Game is copyright Cirr 2014
- fix oscillation of resources
- do not use resource colours in table if resource colours turned off
- remove multiplier from table
- go over save code, add dylan changes, tidy up error handling and detection (maybe add error logging to the actual log i have in the game instead of using alert()) (credit dylan for compression)
- add support for people not having javascript on by showing something along the lines of "you need a javascript to this game!!!"
use sad shark ascii
- change every instance of i in object property loops to k
- x10 more gate kelp
- add sand machine
- add button to toggle button effect help text
- add help text for each action
- add concise help overview in top menu
- add resource categories
- add grouping for resources based on categories [MAKE INTO A PREFERENCE]
- track timestamp of when current run was started, total playing time
	handle case of not having those timestamps by creating it

^^^!! stuff above this line is done !!^^^

- grotto (stats tab), 
	list upgrades, 
	reveal what each resource is supplying in terms of income,
	reveal total amount ever made of resource,
	allows disposal (add disposal message to resource categories)
- research for grotto (stats tab)

- recycler [requires research, research will require machines]
	add junk values to resources
	allow selling (reprocessing?) of things into a new junk resource	
	process junk into new resources (add junk values for resources)

UNUSED POSSIBLE FUTURE STUFF


v World

    - World tab
        - assemble squads from resources!
            - this should be handled automatically, if a squad is needed in a place and one isn't on the way one gets sent
        - select territories to send squads to!
            - choose what sort of squads to send??
        - living world - everything else moves on a timer!
        - home base can never be destroyed
        - other factions cannot have more than three bases

    - combat plans:
    - squads have a faction, a strength, a health and possibly a special feature (implemented via function)
    - factions have bases and squad types (pick random appropriate animal??)
    - bases

    - Gate tab (have it be able to be activated on discovery)

    ~ MOSTLY COMPLETE ~

v Terrain
    - terrains
        - ocean (bluh)
        - caves (attacking squads have strength reduced by 1)
        - chasms (special encounters, occupying squads have health reduced by 1 each tick)
        - fish school (bonus to fish income while occupied)
        - crystals (bonus to tech income while occupied??)

v Chasms
    - get to chasms to fight ancient mechanical abyss creatures (non-diplomatic faction) and collect crystalline fish
    - gate requires some crystalline fish to activate
    - activating gate ends game!
