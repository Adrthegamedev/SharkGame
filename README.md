# Shark Game #

Shark Game is a web game made entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript by Cirrial. It is a game belonging to the "idle" or "incremental" genre. It does not require constant player attention, and can progress while the player does other things before returning to it. This isn't in any way a new or pioneering concept - a lot of people have probably heard of Candy Box or A Dark Room, or the more popular contemporary Cookie Clicker.

## Development Plan ##

Cirrial originally developed this game in about 2014 for a gamejam, but continued to develop it afterward. It quickly became a niche favorite among idle game enthusiasts. After a string of updates, Cirrial dropped development in mid-2015. The final version is v0.71.

While the game is in a more-than-playable state, it remains unfinished. Digging into the codebase, Cirrial developed a relatively simple yet robust engine.
This engine is the reason why this modification is coming to fruition in the first place. Development continues!

By modifying the base engine, behaviors which were previously impossible are made possible. To exhibit this, a new world is already being added,
where a single resource multiplies the production of both animals and specialists.

Contributions welcome. I literally learned javascript by studying cirrial's code, I am not an expert, and I barely understand anything that isn't fully internal.

## Progress ##

Working on a balance sweep before adding new content. Progress is going well, thanks for asking.
